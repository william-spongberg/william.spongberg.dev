## Projects

- [**Google Chrome Built-In AI Challenge**]

  I recently competed in the Google AI Challenge, where myself and a friend created a Google Chrome extension using Google's new Gemini Nano, a locally-run and private AI model. Our extension, called Applify, streamlines the process of applying for jobs online by automatically finding the job's required skills, updating the user's resume and creating a draft cover letter. Find the challenge information [here](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/), and the github repo [here](https://github.com/Chillerbag/Applyify).

- [**Bouncy Balls**]:

  Bouncy Balls is a simple game inspired by the many viral short videos online of balls bouncing around the screen, and the interesting sounds and visual forms they take. The game was created using the Unity2D game engine in a day as a fun little project to play around with the newest version of Unity (version 6). The game is available to play online at itch.io [here](https://wspongberg.itch.io/bouncy-balls), and the android, ios and web builds can be found at the github repo [here](https://github.com/william-spongberg/BouncyBalls).

- **Project 3**: TODO
