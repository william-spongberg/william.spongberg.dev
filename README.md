## About Me

Hello! I'm **Will**, a passionate software developer with experience in creating desktop, web, and mobile applications. I'm currently studying computer science at the **University of Melbourne**, with my main interests being **software engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, and **web development**. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just have a chat!

### Skills

**Python** | **C** | **C#** | **Java** | **SQL** | **JavaScript** | **Flutter** | **Dart** | **Prolog** | **Haskell**

## Projects

These are projects I've completed in my spare time for fun or to learn new tech. I've also included some of the projects I've completed as part of my university studies. Github links are provided for each project, and I'm happy to discuss any of them in more detail if you're interested.

- [**Google Chrome Built-In AI Challenge**](https://github.com/Chillerbag/Applyify)

  I recently competed in the **Google AI Challenge**, where myself and [**Ethan Hawkins**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-hawkins-24486a244/) created a Google Chrome extension using Google's new **Gemini Nano**, a locally-run and private AI model. Our extension, called **Applify**, streamlines the process of applying for jobs online by automatically finding the job's required skills, updating the user's resume and creating a draft cover letter. Find the challenge information [**here**](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/).

- [**Bouncy Balls**](https://github.com/william-spongberg/BouncyBalls)

  **Bouncy Balls** is a simple game inspired by the many viral short videos online of balls bouncing around the screen, and the interesting sounds and visual forms they take. The game was created using the **Unity2D** game engine in a day as a fun little project to play around with the newest version of Unity (version 6). The game is available to play online at itch.io [**here**](https://wspongberg.itch.io/bouncy-balls), and the android and web builds can be found at the linked github repo.

- **Conway's Game of Life - now in [**Haskell**](https://github.com/william-spongberg/haskell-game_of_life) and [**Prolog**](https://github.com/william-spongberg/prolog-game_of_life)!**

  In preparation for my **Declarative Programming** exam in the second half of 2024, I implemented **Conway's Game of Life** into both **Haskell** and **Prolog**. Both versions run fully in the terminal without any extra libraries. I found Haskell to be far more intuitive and easy to work with than Prolog, but I enjoyed the challenge of working with both languages and learning more about functional and logic programming, and it was especially fun to see 

### School Projects

These are projects I've completed as part of my university studies. There are other projects I completed in 2022 and 2023, but these have unfortunately been lost to time. It actually brings me great pain to look at my first couple projects and see how poor my code quality and aversion to git was - I'm glad to see how far I've come since then.

### 2024

#### Sem 2

- [**COMP30019 - Graphics and Interaction**](https://github.com/william-spongberg/COMP30019-Project-2)

  This class was focused on creating video games and the techniques used to create them. The two main projects incremented over my groups's work using the **Unity** game engine, where we created the 3D game **Into the Abyss**. We were given a them - eeriness - and then were tasked with creating a game that fit that theme with complex shading, lighting, and interaction. I lead a team of 4 and we created a game that was well received although unfinished due to time constraints and other commitments.

  I focused on the game's shading, infinite world generation (through use of Perlin noise), post processing and particle systems, and I took great joy in developing a fun and unique game with my fellow students.
  
  Find the trailer [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN0TE6nrwNc), and an early demo of the game can be found [**here**](https://wspongberg.itch.io/into-the-abyss).

- **COMP30022 - IT Project**

  This class was focused on creating a software project from scratch, with a focus on the software development lifecycle and agile methodologies. My group, Sprout, was tasked by [**NoMoss**](https://www.nomoss.co/) to create an **app** that would allow users to track, improve and master skills through the ancient Japanese martial art concept of [**Shuhari**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari). We created the **Momentum Master** app and were well received by both our client and our subject coordinator, and were able to have the app fully functioning and ready for release by the time of the handover.

  I was tasked with helping to implement the backend for this app through a **REST API** in **Node.js** using **TypeScript** that was hosted by **Vercel**, and also helped work on the front end of the app created through **Flutter** and **Dart**.

  Unfortunately, the app is not available for download as it was a private project that we handed over to our client NoMoss and is not for commercial use, but I am happy to discuss the project and show off the app if you are interested.
