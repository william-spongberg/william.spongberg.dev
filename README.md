## About Me

## Projects

- [**Google Chrome Built-In AI Challenge**](https://github.com/Chillerbag/Applyify)

  I recently competed in the Google AI Challenge, where myself and a friend created a Google Chrome extension using Google's new Gemini Nano, a locally-run and private AI model. Our extension, called Applify, streamlines the process of applying for jobs online by automatically finding the job's required skills, updating the user's resume and creating a draft cover letter. Find the challenge information [here](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/).
