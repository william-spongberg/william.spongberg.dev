## Projects

- [**Google Chrome Built-In AI Challenge**](https://github.com/Chillerbag/Applyify)

  I recently competed in the Google AI Challenge, where myself and [Ethan Hawkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-hawkins-24486a244/) created a Google Chrome extension using Google's new Gemini Nano, a locally-run and private AI model. Our extension, called Applify, streamlines the process of applying for jobs online by automatically finding the job's required skills, updating the user's resume and creating a draft cover letter. Find the challenge information [here](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/).

- [**Bouncy Balls**](https://github.com/william-spongberg/BouncyBalls)

  Bouncy Balls is a simple game inspired by the many viral short videos online of balls bouncing around the screen, and the interesting sounds and visual forms they take. The game was created using the Unity2D game engine in a day as a fun little project to play around with the newest version of Unity (version 6). The game is available to play online at itch.io [here](https://wspongberg.itch.io/bouncy-balls), and the android and web builds can be found at the linked github repo.

- **Conway's Game of Life - now in [Haskell](https://github.com/william-spongberg/haskell-game_of_life) and [Prolog](https://github.com/william-spongberg/prolog-game_of_life)!**

  In preparation for my Declarative Programming exam in the seconds half of 2024, I implemented Conway's Game of Life into both Haskell and Prolog. Both versions run fully in the terminal without any extra libraries.
